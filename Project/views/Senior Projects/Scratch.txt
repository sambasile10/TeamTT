roller board where wheels lock just before takeoff, or when force is applied

use piston to simulate compression
	
keep force profile constant throughout takeoff

maximize force of takeoff and minimizing drag polar
pareto front

machine learning to optimize form

focus on simulation and data collection from that, stretch to in-jump data acquistion and correlation to performance

performance over portability


minimize difference between training and actual jump
forces more important than speed

rewarding physical feedback, correct force profile leeds to higher jumps

fis has standard jumps

find one model jump to start

monday 8am meeting

air density based on location
